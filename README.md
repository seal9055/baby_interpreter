## Rust-based Javascript Interpreter in progress

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Recursive descent parser + register based bytecode vm. Currently able to
interpret simple expressions and statements while maintaining scopes. Control
flow via functions, conditionals and loops is possible, however return values
are not yet supported so all functions are still void.
